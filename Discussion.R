#Questions to ask
#What is a prior and posterior distribution?
#What is Uncertainty Quantification
#Buhlmanns credibility estimator and the Gibbs Posterior Distribution

#objectives of the paper:
#In predicting for future insurance claims, 
#typically, a full Bayesian Analysis is often used as the prime mechanism
#However, a Bayesian Analysis is reliant on the proposed model being correctly specified. 

#Whereas the Buhlmann's Credibility estimator gives a simple approximation 
#to the Bayesian Analysis in Predicting for future insurance claims. 

#We show that the asymptotic behavior of the bayesian Posterior distribution
#will result in damaging effects, resulting in inaccurate reference and prediction, 
#should our model be misspecified. 

#credibility estimator on the other hand, is no affected by the 
#model being misspecified, giving an advantage of the Bayesian approach
#where the situation involves the model is being specified incorrectly. 

#Objective and Conjecture - 
#Should we completely disregard the uncertainty quantification 
#under a bayesian posterior distribution given in situations where the 
#model is misspecified? 

#Want to conclude no, and we introduce an Alternative Gibbs Posterior construction. 
#Further more, this alternative is a new characterization of the 
#credibility estimator.

Estimation and Model Misspecification for Insurance Claims

This project helps the user to see how an actuary can still estimate insurance claims when given a misspecified model. We discover this 
fact through the usage of a Gibbs Posterior, a distribution that does not depend on a statistical model. 

This project presents different cases of estimating risk measures.
